# ML-project-forest-fire-prediction
In this project, we focused on whether certain weather features could predict Fire Weather Index.

* I used a dataset on **Algerian Forest Fires** from UCI. The dataset contains a culmination of forest fire observations and data in two regions
  of Algeria: the Bejaia region and the Sidi Bel-Abbes region. The timeline of this dataset is from **June 2012 to September 2012**. In this
  project, we focused on whether certain weather features could predict forest fires in these regions using few Classification algorithms.
  
* In this project I choose regression(Linear regression, Ridge regression, Lasso regression, Elastic Net Regression) problem to predict fire weather index.
